-- List current monitors and supported resolutions with: hyprctl monitors all

-- Monitor scale is Hyprland's scale for the output. It sizes everything
-- Wayland-native, accepts fractions (1.6, 1.75), and applies immediately.
-- "auto" lets Hyprland pick per display.
--
-- Left on "auto", which matches hypr/config/monitors.lua on the Noctalia side:
-- that file pins known panels by desc: and falls through to an auto catch-all
-- for everything else. The Air's internal panel reports an empty EDID
-- description (`hyprctl monitors all` shows description ''), so there is
-- nothing to match on and the catch-all is the only way to reach it. "auto"
-- picks 2 on its 2560x1600 panel, giving 1280x800 logical.
local omarchy_monitor_scale = "auto"
hl.monitor({ output = "", mode = "preferred", position = "auto", scale = omarchy_monitor_scale })

-- Configure a specific monitor.
-- hl.monitor({ output = "DP-2", mode = "2560x1440@144", position = "0x0", scale = 1 })

-- Portrait/rotated secondary monitor (transform: 1 = 90°, 3 = 270°).
-- hl.monitor({ output = "DP-2", mode = "preferred", position = "auto", scale = 1, transform = 1 })

-- GDK scale is GDK_SCALE, the factor GTK draws its own UI at. It's what
-- sizes X11/XWayland windows, which Omarchy leaves unscaled so they stay
-- crisp instead of being stretched by the compositor. GTK only honors whole
-- numbers, so use the nearest integer to the monitor scale, and restart an
-- app for a change to reach it.
